## How to contribute.
1. Locate a task on the [project board](https://github.com/DavidMGardner/sogeti-portfolio/projects/7) and assign it to yourself.
2. Create a new branch and complete the task
3. Submit a pull request to master.

## Running the API
1. `cd server`  
2. `DB_USER="{username}" DB_PWD="{pwd}" npm run dev`    
The #portfolio-ato-proj Slack channel has the values for the environment variables which you can use to connect to the mlab database. You could run mongodb locally in which case you can override the database connection string with the DB_CONN environment variable.
