## Running the API
From the server folder (in bash),  
`DB_USER="{username}" DB_PWD="{pwd}" npm run dev`  
The #portfolio-ato-proj Slack channel has the values for the environment variables which you can use to connect to the mlab database. You could run mongodb locally in which case you can override the database connection string with the DB_CONN environment variable.

## Running the UI
`npm run start`
